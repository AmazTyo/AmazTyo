         <h2>TWELVE PILLARS: PILLARS 4-7</h2>
         <h3>Pillar 4: Achieve Your Goals</h3>
         <p>"The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes you to accomplish." Goal setting is deciding where you want to go and then designing a plan to getting there. Pillar 4 is all about using goals to help you get what you want in life, applying pillar 4 to my life I will a begin the simple act of writing down my goals then I would seperate each goals into the category of long term and short term goals.</p>
         <br>
         <br>
         <h3>Pillar 5: The Proper Use of Time</h3>
         <p>"Everyday has many opportunities, but only best opportunity.". One of the best things to do with time management is to know the difference between important tasks and urgent tasks. I should really apply this to my life, where I begin completeing important task at the begining of my day and ensuring in managing my time more efficiently; by spending my day wisely.</p>
         <br>
         <br>
         <h3>Pillar 6: Surround Yourself With the Best People</h3>
         <p>"Don't join an easy crowd; you won't grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high." The people you associate with play a big part in what you get in life, learn to asscoaite with successful people, people who you want to become like, people who already have what you want try to avoid people who are holding you back. I ahve already applied this to my life where I am associating myself with succesful people and letting go of the ones who are holding me back </p>
         <br>
         <br>
         <h3>Pillar 7: Be a Life Long Learner</h3>
         <p>"Formal education will make you a living. Self eduaction will make you a fortune." Self eduaction or lifelong learning is what you teach yourself it occurs outside of a formal educational instistute such as school, unniversity or corporate training it is important to create a habit of constant learning. This can be done by simply reading a book. I am an avid reader, I love reading books have taught me alot things I know today and as stated above I am a very curious person I am never done learning, I have a natural guide to explore, learn and grow.</p>
